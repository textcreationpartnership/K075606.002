1. HORACE, BOOK I. SAT. I.

1. ON MRS. PHILIPPS'S DEATHMrs. Catharine Philipps, better known by the poetical name of Orinda, was the daughter of John Fowler, merchant▪ and born in London, 1631, as Wood and Ballard (in 1633 according to Jacob); was married to James Philipps, of the Priory of Cardigan, eſq. about the year 1647; and died in Fleet-ſtreet, in the month of June, 1664. Her poems, including two tragedies, "Horace" and "Pompey," both tranſlated from Corneille, were collected in a folio volume, and afterwards reprinted in octavo. She was alſo the writer of 〈◊〉 volume of Letters (publiſhed many years after her death) 〈◊〉 Sir Charles Cotterel, intituled,
"Letters from Orinda to P•liarchus;" which have been much admired.
" Orinda's works, with courtly graces ſtor'd," True ſenſe in nice expreſſions will afford."Dr. King, vol. III. p. ••…
Mrs. Philipps was as much famed for her friendſhip, as 〈◊〉 her poetry; and had the good fortune to be equally eſteem• by the beſt poet and the beſt divine of her age. Dr. Jeremy Taylor addreſſed his diſcourſe
"on the nature and effects of friendſhip" to this lady; and Mr. Cowley has celebrated her memory, in an Ode particularly diſtinguiſhed by the very learned and ſagacious editor of his "Select Works."—The induſtrious Mr. Langbaine ſays,
"ſhe was one that equalled the Leſbian Sappho, and Roman Sulpicia: as they were praiſed by Horace, Martial, Auſonius, and other antient poets; ſo was this lady commended by the earls of Orrery and Roſcommon, by Cowley, Flatman, and other eminent poets."
Sir John Denham added a fifth act to her tragedy of "Horace," which was performed at court by perſons of quality, in 1678. In the prologue, ſpoken by the duke of Monmouth, it was obſerved, that
" While a woman Horace did tranſlate," Horace did riſe above a Roman ſtate."
The commendation ſhe received from Lord Roſcommon is thus handſomely returned by Mrs. Philipps:
"Lord Roſcommon is certainly one of the moſt promiſing young noblemen in Ireland. He has paraphraſed a Pſalm admirably; and a ſcene of Paſtor Fido very finely, in ſome places much better than Sir Richard Fanſhaw. This was undertaken merely 〈◊〉 compliment to me, who happened to ſay that it was the be•• ſcene in Italian, and the worſt in Engliſh. He was only two hours about it.
It begins thus:
" Dear happy groves, and you the dark retreat" Of ſilent horrour, Reſt's eternal ſeat."
From theſe lines, which are ſince ſomewhat mended, it appears that he did not think a work of two hours fit to endure the eye of criticiſm without reviſal. When Mrs. Philipps was in Ireland, ſome ladies, that had ſeen her tranſlation of Pompey, reſolved to bring it on the ſtage at Dublin; and, to promote their deſign, Lord Roſcommon gave them a prologue, and Sir Edward Dering an epilogue; "which," ſays ſhe,
"are the beſt performances of thoſe kinds I eve• ſaw."
If this is not criticiſm, it is at leaſt gratitude▪ The thought of bringing Caeſar and Pompey into Ireland▪ the only country over which Caeſar never had any power▪ is lucky.—I need not point out the part of theſe remarks for which I am indebted to Lord Roſcommon's incomparab•• Biographer. N..

1. ARISTAEUSAriſtaeus was ſon of Cyrene, daughter to one of the ancient kings of Arcadia; and by Apollo as was believed or at leaſt reported. His birth was concealed, and he was ſent to be privately brought up among the ſhepherds of Arcadia; where, grown a man, he applied himſelf wholly to the cares and ſtores of a country life, in all which he ſucceeded, ſo as to grow renowned for his knowledge and wealth. He was eſteemed the firſt inventor of cheeſe, oil, and honey, or rather of the art of hiving bees, which before were wild, and their ſtocks found only by chance and in hollow trees. For this he was worſhiped among the Arcadians as ſon of Apollo, and as other inventors of things neceſſary or moſt uſeful to human life. He fell in love with Eurydice newly eſpouſed to Orpheus; and by his purſuit of her was the occaſion of her death, being bitten by a ſnake as ſhe fled from him. This was followed by the death of Orpheus after a long and incurable grief, whereupon Ariſtaeus was by the nymphs, companions of Eurydice, plagued in all his ſtores, but moſt of all in his bees, of which he was fondeſt, till he loſt them all, and was in deſpair ever to recover them: but, by the advice of his mother and of Proteus, to whom ſhe ſent him, he came to find out both the true cauſe of his loſs, and means of retrieving it.

"Threni Cantabrigienſes in Funere duorum Principum, Henrici Gloceſtrenſis, & Mariae Arauſionenſis, ſ•reniſſimi Regis Caroli II. Fratris & Sororis. Cantab. 1661."
For copies of this and the following poem I am indebted to a volume in the Lambeth Library, 39. 6. 13. fol. moſt obligingly communicated by Dr. Ducarel.—The Reader will not be diſpleaſed at being preſented with two Latin poems (though perhaps of no ſuperior excellence) by ſo capital a writer. By the ſecond of them it appears that in 1662 he had the degree of B.A. and had obtained a fellowſhip; though neither of thoſe academical honours attended has name in 1661. One of his earlieſt productions (written in 1650, the year he went to College) is already printed in vol. I. p. 181. with a prologue and two epilogues to "The Duke of Guiſe," none of which are in any edition of his works. If theſe poems had come to light before the publication of Dr. Johnſon's excellent Life of Dryden, that judicious Biographer would certainly have made ſome alteration in the following paragraph:—"At the univerſity he does not appear to have been eager of poetical diſtinction, or to have laviſhed his early wit either on fictitious ſubjects or publick occaſions. He probably conſidered that he who purpoſed to be an author, ought firſt to be a ſtudent. He obtained, whatever was the reaſon, no fellowſhip in the College. Why he was excluded, cannot now be known, and it is vain to gueſs; had he thought himſelf injured, he knew how to complain. In the Life of Pl•tarch he mentions his education in the College with gratitude; but in a prologue at Oxford, he has theſe lines:
Oxford to him a dearer name ſhall beThan his own mother-univerſity;Thebes did his rude unknowing youth engage:He chooſes Athens in his riper age.
It was not till the death of Cromwell, in 1658, that he became a publick candidate for fame, by publiſhing Heroick Stanza• on the late Lord Protector; which, compared with the verſes of Sprat and Waller on the ſame occaſion, were ſufficient to raiſe great expectations of the riſing poet." I had not ſeen theſe poems when the note in vol. I. p. 181. was printing N..

1. TO THE EARL OF MIDDLETONCharles Middleton, the ſecond earl of that title, and baron Clairmont, was ſecretary of ſtate for Scotland from the year 1684 to the Revolution; when he followed king James into France, and was attainted by the Scots parliament in 1695. He married lady Catharine daughter of Robert earl of Cardigan, by whom he had two ſons, John lord Clairmont, and Charles Middleton, eſq who were both taken at ſea by admiral Byng, in the deſcent which the French intended upon Scotland in 1708; but, by the queen's orders, they were ſoon releaſed, and died in France without iſſue. Their father was alſo aboard in that armament. He had two daughters; lady-Elizabeth, wife of Edward, ſon of James earl of Perth; and lady Mary, wife of ſir John Gifford, knight.—"He is one of the pleaſanteſt companions in the world."
 Macky.—"Sir William Temple told me, he was a very valuable man; and a good ſcholar I once ſaw him." 
SWIFT, MS.—In Harl. MSS. are ſeveral of his letters to the earl of Oxford; in one of which, 1729, he thus recommends the chevalier Ramſay:
"To a great deal of erudition he joins as many and great good qualities as I ever met in any man."
In another, he tells lord Oxford, who wiſhed to exchange ſome literary curioſities with the French king,
"You are too modeſt; and that is not the way to deal with the people of this country."—An affecting ſtory of the honourable Charles Middleton (ſecond ſon of the earl) is related by the counteſs of Pomfret, in Duncombe's collection of Letters, vol. II. p. 125. 2d edit. N..

June 23, 1646.

1. HORTI ARLINGTONIANI.

1. TRANSLATED BY MR. SAM. BOYSESon of Joſeph Boyſe, a Diſſenting miniſter of great eminence in Dublin (who was one of the 16 children of Mr. Matthew Boyſe of Leeds) well known by his controverſial writings againſt Abp. King.—Samuel was born in 1708, and received his education at Dublin; at 18, he was ſent to the univerſity of Glaſgow; and, marrying before he was 20, returned to Dublin with his wife, where the conduct of neither was commendable. The huſband, who had no graces of perſon and fewer ſtill of converſation, paſſed his time in abject trifling; the wife, in intrigue: and their extravagance reduced his father to indigence. In 1731 young Boyſe reſided at Edinburgh, where he publiſhed a volume of poems, addreſſed to the counteſs of Egleton, the patroneſs of all men of wit. Here alſo Mr. Boyſe particularly diſtinguiſhed himſelf by an elegy, called "The Tears of the Muſes," on the death of the viſcounteſs Stormont; which introduced him to the noble viſcount; and alſo to the dutcheſs of Gordon, who had engaged for him an office in the cuſtoms, which he loſt by an unpardonable remiſſneſs. The dutcheſs ſent him to London with recommendations to Mr. Pope and the lord chancellor King. He went to Twickenham; but, the po• not being at home, he never repeated the viſit; by the peer he was moſt graciouſly received. From this period he wrote many poems; but thoſe, though excellent in their kind (and ſufficient, it is ſaid, to have filled at leaſt ſix volumes) were loſt to the world, by being introduced with no advantage. He had ſo ſtrong a propenſity to groveling, that his acquaintance were generally of ſuch a caſt as could be of no ſervice to him; and thoſe in higher life he addreſſed by letters, not having ſufficient confidence or politeneſs to converſe familiarly with them; a freedom to which he was intitled by the power of his genius. His genius was not confined to poetry only; but he had a taſte for painting, muſic, and heraldry, with the latter of which he was well acquainted. Many of his poems are in the Gent. Mag. ſigned Y. and Alceus. In 1743 he publiſhed his "Albion's Triumph," an ode on the battle of Dettingen; and in or about 1745 wrote an admirable poem called "The Deity," which Mr. Pope declared, on its publication, contained many lines of which he ſhould not be aſhamed. It was alſo commended by the late Henry Fielding, who gave a quotation from it, (ſee Tom Jones, B. vii. •. 1.) and at the ſame time very juſtly ſtyled it a noble on• This unfortunate man, by addicting himſelf to low vices, among which were gluttony and extravagance, rendered himſelf ſo contemptible and wretched, that he frequently was without the leaſt ſubſiſtence for days together. After ſquan••ring away in a dirty manner any money which he acquired, he has been known to pawn all his apparel; and in that ſtate was frequently confined to his bed, ſitting up with his arms through holes in a blanket, writing verſes in order to procure the means of exiſtence. It ſeems hardly credible, but it is certainly true, that he was more than once in that deplorable •ituation, and to the end of his life never derived any advan•ge from the experience of his paſt ſufferings. A late col•ector of poems (Mr. Giles) ſays, he was informed by Mr. •by the bookſeller, that this unhappy man at laſt was •nd dead in his bed, with a pen in his hand, and in the 〈◊〉 of writing, in the ſame manner as above deſcribed. He •ed in Shoe-Lane, in May, 1749, and was buried at the ex•ce of the pariſh. See Gent. Mag. 1779, p. 32; and ••ber's Lives of the Poets, vol. V. p. 160. N..

1. ON THE KING'S HOUSE, BUILDING AT WINCHESTEROn or near the ſcite of King Arthur's Caſtle, king Charles II. in 1683 laid the foundation of a magnificent royal palace, only the ſhell of which was finiſhed. A cupola was deſigned 30 feet higher than the roof, which would have been ſeen at ſea; and a ſtreet was intended leading from the Weſt end of the chathedral to the centre of the front. The length of the whole is 328 feet. A park was alſo projected ten miles in circumference; but the death of the king prevented the progreſs and execution of this noble plan. The palace is at preſent converted into a commodious priſon for French priſoners of war. See Warton's Deſcription of Wincheſter, p. 11. N..

1. TO CHARLES EARL OF DORSET"Of the earl of Dorſet the character has been drawn ſo largely and ſo elegantly by Prior [Engliſh Poets, vol. XXX. p. 9.] to whom he was familiarly known, that nothing can be added by a caſual hand.—He was a man whoſe elegance and judgement were univerſally confeſſed, and whoſe bounty to the learned and witty was generally known."
Dr. JOHNSON.—To this ſhort but comprehenſive eulogy, it would be preſumption to think of adding. N..

1. TO WALTER MOYLEThis ingenious writer was born in Cornwall, 1672. After paſſing ſome years at Oxford, he was removed to the Temple, where he entered deeply into the nobler parts of the law;
("for there was a drudgery, ſays Mr. Hammond, in the law-lucrative, which he could not ſubmit to.")
Here firſt he formed an intimacy with Dryden, Hammond, Hopkins, and other contemporary wits. He was for ſome time a member of parliament, where he always acted a very honourable and diſintereſted part; and afterwards retired to his ſeat at Bake in Cornwall, where he applied himſelf very diligently to ſtudy; and died June 9, 1721. Two volumes of his poſt humous writings were publiſhed in 1726; and thoſe he had printed in his life-time were collected in 1727 by his friend Mr. Hammond, who wrote his Life. N., ESQ.

1. TO ANTHONY HAMMONDTo this gentleman Mr. Hopkins inſcribed his
"Epiſtolary Poems and Tranſlations," in a dedication worth preſerving:
"The following verſes ought in juſtice to be yours, ſince not only the beſt part of them were made at your houſe, but they were made deſignedly for you, ſo that this is not a de•ication written to a book, but a book written to a dedication; which, however, is the niceſt part a writer has to manage; for the moſt deſerving men are the moſt averſe to be told ſo, and what would pleaſe all their friends and acquaintance would diſpleaſe themſelves; which makes the poet at a loſs whether to diſſatisfy one or many, his readers or his patron. But, ſince I have already found it eaſier to you to oblige, than to receive thanks for an obligation; to do no violence to your modeſty, I muſt do one to my own juſtice, and deſiſt from a theme which I could ſo willingly enlarge upon, but you ſo unwillingly read. I ſhall ſay little of the following eſſays, either of the originals I tranſlated them from, or the tranſlations: one thing in general I find from my own experience; that where there is moſt life and ſpirit in the author, the tranſlator is carried on with the greater vigour and vivacity, as a man ſwims faſter in a ſtream than a ſtanding water; but where the original is flat and low, the tranſlator muſt be at the pains to raiſe him; ſo that the beſt things are the eaſieſt to be done, and the dulleſt the moſt difficult. It were preſumption in one of my years, to pretend to give an account of the authors whom I have choſen, or their works; to commend their excellences, or condemn their faults: and of the two, I dare venture to ſay the leaſt of Ovid; when he himſelf, and all that he has written, have been already ſo well and ſo fully treated of in Mr. Dryden's preface before his epiſtles. But I cannot chooſe but wonder, that a book ſo extremely delightful, ſo ſoft and ſweet, as Tibullus, has lain ſo long unattempted; but there is a friend of ours, whom I hope he has been all along reſerved for, and then he will be in the beſt hands he could have fallen into. Of the three elegies that I have ventured on, the firſt, from toward the middle to the end, and the whole third, pleaſed me infinitely; the ſecond I did merely for the ſake of the laſt ten or twelve lines. Tibullus moſt, certainly, have felt all he wrote, for he could never have feigned ſo much paſſion ſo well; and I am apt to believe it was not his poetry made him ſo fond and tender a lover, but rather his love that made him ſo ſweet and excellent a poet. Were it not that I ſhould take him out of better hands, I would have attempted to have engliſhed him all; for I flatter myſelf with a fancy, that, in ſome things, I am ſomewhat of his temper; and how far ſhort ſoever I come or him in his poetry, I reſemble him but too nearly in ſome other circumſtances. I was almoſt running into a complaint, that would have been both unjuſt and ingrateful; for, ſince I knew you, all occaſion of complaint has been taken from me. Your acquaintance would have been of itſelf ſufficient to endear you to any man; but your favours to me began with, and even out-ran, your acquaintance. I dare not proceed, though on a ſubject which I am very loth to leave; permit me to add only this, that ſince moſt who ever wrote have ſometimes ſtood in need of favours from other men, and ſince the ſame fortune has attended me, I am glad, however, that it threw me on you to receive them, than whom I know none I could have been more willingly obliged to for them. I am, Sir, your moſt affectionate, obliged, humble ſervant, CHARLES HOPKINS."Of Mr. Hammond as a poet, I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak hereafter; of his ſon, the incomparable author of the "Love Elegies," much may be hoped for from Dr. Johnſon.
